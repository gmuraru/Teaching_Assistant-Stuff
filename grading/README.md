### Grading

##### How to use
* Create an archive with all the homework using the get_homeworks script - it must be run on elf; you need
permissions for a specific course to do so.
* Change the assign_hw.py script such that you will have the correct info:
  * the teaching assistants
  * the string to parse for the final grade
  * the final grade score
  * the bonus score

* The script will create a number of grade.vmr files for each teaching assistant and should be shared with the others TAs
* After everyone finishes grading you need to run the grade.sh script on the elf with the grade files from each TA
